# VITA_pharmacy_scraper



As a training, I decided to get ALL the data about ALL the products from the site "https://vitaexpress.ru/". 

As an example, I have uploaded some .json files which are full of information about: 
- product_name
- product_url
- product_brand
- product_categories
- product_price
- active substance

Firstly install these libs :
- -bs4
- -selenium
- -json

If you run the script, you will have a lot of such files! (But you will have to wait about 75 minutes, because of scrolling page script part)
